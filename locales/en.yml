That’s where we come in: with a strong background in <strong>statistics</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, we know how to collect, handle and analyze a <strong>huge amount of data</strong>. By applying powerful algorithms, we help you find patterns and extract <strong>useful information</strong> for your business."

He likes samba, forró, bossa nova, jazz and football (the real one). But this quietness ends when he starts coding and turns into a hyper-focused typing machine."

    history:
      title: "History"
      text-a: "It isn’t very hard to imagine how we got started. Just picture three good programmers, back in 2011, who went to college together living in a city packed with software factories. (Almost) no one ever talked about “agile”, and we had a problem with that: full of ideas and opinions on how software should be made, we decided to create a different place, one where we’d actually want to work. That’s how “Guavaberry” started off, as a stronghold of quality software (later we heard “drop the berry” from a Napster dude)."
      text-b: "From there on, it was all smooth sailing. We've started working with many clients worldwide and kept growing. Our team got bigger, acquiring a whole new set of special skills throughout the years. And we hope this is only the beginning."

Specifically, we discuss the business opportunities and challenges; gather existing knowledge about what you want to solve, create or improve; list direct and indirect competitors; and, finally, we set expectations and goals for the project."
      text-b: "After that, we elaborate together an overview of what you want to build, describing requirements as (broad) <span class='is-sidenote-link' data-sidenote='user-stories'>user stories</span>. They are then prioritized by business value, defining a roadmap with milestones. Just like any road, there may be detours and bumps, and the chosen path may not be the best one to reach our destination. But don't panic, we are prepared to change course should the need arise."
      text-c: "The last part of the Kick-off is defining team and roles: <span class='is-sidenote-link' data-sidenote='derp'>DERP</span>, <span class='is-sidenote-link' data-sidenote='product-owner'>Product Owner</span> and <span class='is-sidenote-link' data-sidenote='builders'>Builders</span>."

By getting to know the users and relating to them, we aim to learn and understand their goals, pain-points and expectations. But don’t worry, we don’t keep them captive: this information is collected through interviews, research and contextual observation. Then, we analyze the data and create personas to represent potential users."

      title: "Publishing"
      text: "When your software is ready to use — or at least has the minimum viable features your users need —, it's time to publish it to the world. There are two moments of publishing: staging and production. The first one is for limited testing purposes, and the second is when it's deployed for all users to, well, use it. This is also the time when we perform tasks such as migrating data from previous systems or configuring integrations with external services."
    interlude:
      lead: "Discovery, Build and Publishing wrap up one iteration. While the application is not complete, we keep getting back to the beginning of the Craft Cycle to develop new features or improve them."
    maintenance:
      title: "Maintenance"
      text-a: "We continuously monitor the app's availability, making sure it is up and running, ready to be used. We also keep track of performance metrics, scaling servers up and down as usage varies. This way we keep your software running fast without wasting resources (a.k.a. money)."
      text-b: "We set up and track metrics that are relevant to your business, making it easy for you to keep an eye on both standard and custom <span class='is-sidenote-link' data-sidenote='key-performance'>key performance indicators</span>. And, by the way, during maintenance we also fix possible bugs and make small adjustments to make the app work just like you need."
      quote: "We keep your software running fast without wasting resources."
    closing:
      lead: "We know your project is unique, and so is our process each time we follow it. Nothing is set in stone and each step can be adapted to suit your goals and purposes."
    footnote:
      text: "We stand on the shoulders of giants. Huge kudos to these great people who inspired us: Gothelf’s Lean UX, Knapp’s Design Sprint, IDEO’s User Centred Design, Garret’s Elements of User Experience, SCRUM and others."
